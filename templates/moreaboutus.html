        <h2> What Is the Importance of Strategy in Business</h2>
    Corporations are founded by people as a means of achieving their goals as well as their visions of what the business ought to be. Thereafter, objectives and policies are set and put into practice. Combined, goals, visions and plans constitute strategies set forth to be achieved in the long or short term.
    Strategic management process is based on the formulation, implementation and evaluation of an entire business organization (David, 2006). Strategy in business terms refers to the direction and scope which an organization has over a long-term period and which helps it in achieving the best using the available resources within a highly competitive environment (Lippmann & Rumelt, 2003). Strategies should be designed in such a way that the business meets the market needs as well as stakeholder satisfaction.
Different organizations develop and execute their strategies in unique ways motivated by the need to gain advantage over other businesses within the same environment. Applying mediocre strategy as well as the analysis of the industry environment by firms are definite preferences over ad-hoc or superb strategies and their evaluations. The essay seeks to provide an analysis of the application of strategy by different business organizations.
What Are the Strategies to Make a Business Successful?<br>
The use of strategy can be found at different levels of any business organization which ranges from the business in general to particular individuals operating the business. Three levels where strategy operates have been identified (Lippmann & Rumelt, 2003). Corporate strategy seeks to meet the needs of all the stakeholders through the operations of the organization.
    <br>
This level is central to the success of the business since it involves the great influence of investors. Corporate strategy serves to provide guidance in the decision-making process in the entire business. Most, if not all businesses have their corporate strategy clearly spelt out in the “mission statement” from which all other strategies emanate (Stalk & Evans, 2002).
The second is business unit strategy which is designed to guide how a given business survives the tough competition presented by similar operators within the same market environment (David, 2006). This strategy inspires important decisions ranging from the choice of appropriate products, customer satisfaction, overcoming competition, to the exploitation and creation of new business opportunities.
The last strategy employed in strategic management is the operational strategy which guides decisions on how the organization is structured in order to ensure that the business is operating at its maximum potential (Lippmann & Rumelt, 2003). The importance of this strategy is that it facilitates the implementation of the other two strategies mentioned earlier.
Operational strategy is concerned with decisions touching on the effective use of available resources, the various processes within the business, and human resource or labor. These three types of strategy are very beneficial to a business organization when it comes to making important decisions.
    <br>
Many companies and organizations have realized the importance of formulating sound strategies. Strategies help organizations take key actions that facilitate the achievement of milestones and results which would not be easy to attain without strategy formulation (Stalk & Evans, 2002).<br>
Strategic planning acts as a guide for all the stakeholders in the organization since it sets out clear vision of what the business seeks to achieve both in the short and long-term. Many theories have been used in the business sector to guide operations. For instance, the entrepreneurial decision process model describing opportunity recognition by organization managers has been very resourceful (Pech & Cameron, 2006).
Strategy formulation helps organizations to anticipate future business trends and to prepare adequately for the foreseeable market competition and opportunities. Guided by sound strategies, organizations will be able to invest their capital funds wisely and hence get maximum returns on investments (Stalk & Evans, 2002). It is evident, therefore, that an organization without strategy will not be able to withstand the challenge from its competitors causing a decline in their share of the market as well as in their sales.

    <h2>Factors of an Effective Business Strategy</h2>
A sound strategy can be formulated by considering some key elements. The organization has to define the nature of the business that is to be pursued, state a clear mission of the business, set strategic goals and the expected performance, formulate a business strategy, implement the set strategy and finally evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy from time to time and making necessary improvements (Faulkner & Cliff, 2005).
Business Definition <br>
Any business organization has to understand the type of customers being targeted and then defined from their perspective (Abell, 1980). Customers are the central pillars of all businesses since they are the source of revenue and hence determine how far the business would withstand the test of time (Rumelt, 1993).<br>
The first step in designing a sound strategy is to put in place measures that will ensure a strong customer base. Developing products and enhancing their quality through efficient means of production may help some organizations to achieve success. However, maintaining a chain of committed customers is crucial in attaining prosperity since pricing may not be a major determinant of the number of customers (Porter, 2003).
